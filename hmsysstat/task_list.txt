---To Do---

    Sometime along the way, figure out what would be a good naming convention for my own branches of the hirschmann_shared and linux_eagle,
    create those branches and switch to them.

---In progress---

    Modify the main Makefile and/or other makefiles in the project to get my target compiled and inserted into the EAGLE build.

    Continued research. (Will most probably remain In Progress during the entire developing process)

---Done---

    Implement the work module. Will consist of 2 threads, one of them will do the actual work of receiving and sending packets, while the other will handle new client connections.
        - It will also habe a third thread, which will be monitor the CPU usage. It's output will be polled for the CPUINFO packet.

    Choose a way to start the work module from the control module (a new thread? a new process?).
        - New thread approach choosen

    Implement a communication channel between the SNMP handler (hm2sysstatMIB.c) and the SNMP agent or control module or work module.
        - Done by including the header of the work module in the SNMP handler source file, thus the getters and setters are being exposed to
          the handler.

    Configure hm2sysstatMIB.c for proper get and set of the scalars.

    Trim and filter hmctl_templ_skel.c to exactly what I need. Add stuff if necessary. 
        - Might actually need all of it, at least for now. May be reopened sometime after the first successful build.

    Write the necessary MIB.

    Install mib2c and generate the needed template code for the two scalars.

---Review---

    Figure out if my application would be interested in the system events provided by the ESM.
        - So far so good. Things are very clear until after the control module reaches the HM_ESM_STATE_RUNNING state. The circumstances
          and the subsequent actions are unclear in the event that HM_ESN_STATE_RECONF is reached.

    Write and integrate the function that initializes the SNMP agent.
        - Without the mib2c generated functions at the moment. (init_hm2SampleAppIntVariable(), init_hm2SampleAppOperation(), 
          init_hm2SampleAppVerbose(), init_hm2SampleAppStatus())
        - Should be done by the end of the day
        -- UPDATE: Done
        --- UPDATE: mib2c template functions done
